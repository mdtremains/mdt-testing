Ohio based Graphic Designer and Photographer, who strives to overcome creative challenges with zeal and determination.  I am currently a junior at Ohio Northern University working towards a B.F.A. in Graphic Design. While I am a Design Major I have a passion for photography, and love incorporating my photos with design whenever I can. I believe that there is always a solution to a problem, and that being a team player is essential in any environment. In my free time I enjoy playing piano, making and eating food, cuddling with my kitties, crocheting, watching movies with my family, and vacationing in Michigan or anywhere with a beach. A random fun fact: I cannot eat an ice cream cone in the summer fast enough without it melting all over my entire hand.
