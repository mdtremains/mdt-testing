Social responsibility is being discussed more and more frequently within 
the graphic design profession. Graphic design is a powerful means of 
communicating civic messages and stimulating thinking about the issues 
that define our world. A handbill can be designed well with a civic 
message about the act of voting. This project introduced the importance 
of a social and ethical approach to my work. The primary intention of 
this project was to explore various aspects of the fundamental design 
principle of contrast. Required to experiment with: negative/positive 
relationships, scale and patterning, framal reference, Gestalt theory, 
design principles and elements. 

Parameters Include: message must be nonpartisan, black and white only, 
punctuation used must be from the Futura font family, use only letterforms 
and punctuations to visually interpret an idea or saying about voting.
