Goal: To convey and understand the expressive potential of 
typography through form and structure, and to think of type 
as an interpretive, expressive medium. The early modernist 
movements served as passionate ?voices? reacting to their 
social/political environment through typographic form, 
language, performance and activism. The energy of a new 
world order replaced the passivity of the past. Form and 
voice merged into a dynamic whole. The rapid advancements 
in science, technology and social order demanded banning 
the old and forming the new. This book jacket extends 
beyond the typographic to include the cultural motivations, 
technologies and beliefs of the early modernists within the 
De Stijl movement.

Parameters Included: conduct research on assigned movement, 
check out one book from library about assigned movement, 
brainstorm to find visually metaphoric possibilities.
