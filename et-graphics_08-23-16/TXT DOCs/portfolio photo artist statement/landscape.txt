Landscape Project- Artists Statement {September 2014}

A given definition of landscape is the page of a book where it is wider than it is high. T
his definition gave root to the creative process I took for my project. I began exploring 
the idea of landscapes of books, and the setting in which they are kept, the library. The 
end result of this was multiple close ups of different aspects of the library. 
A lot of the photographs taken posses focused foregrounds with a blurry faded background, 
lending it a vintage old-world feel. I really like this common feeling and color theme among 
the photos, and tried to enhance the feeling through focusing my photographs of books on more 
tattered, timeworn looking books-ones that clearly display the amount of handling that 
they have endured through the years.
 
Light played a key role in highlighting common colors throughout the different images, and accenting 
these worn or faded parts of the books beings captured. Most of my photographs capture warmer tones, 
consisting of gold and neutral tones that I personally associate with antiques. I found that the amount 
of light present in the photograph either muted the warm tones or played these tones up making them 
pop in contrast to each other. 

The use of light to accentuate the golden and neutral aged color present on the pages and 
covers of the books was ironic since light is a factor that causes the age to occur in the 
first place; thus displaying the circle of life between different fragments of life present 
throughout time. So being able to find the same faded golden, neutral aged color in other 
parts of the library really tied together the whole antique feeling. For me, light truly ties
 together the beauty present in all things, old and new, from the past, in the present, 
 and to emanate in the future.
