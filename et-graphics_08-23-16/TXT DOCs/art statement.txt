I approach my work by viewing the world from various perspectives. 
Perception is everything, and understanding how to recognize and 
apply these perspectives to my work has helped me grow as an artist 
and an individual. I want my work to positively impact the world 
around me and make people stop and reflect. Ideally my work will 
help viewers reflect on their life, personal matters they have or 
bringing new issues to light for them, and make an impression on 
their views of the world. I believe in the power of visual language, 
and the impact that occurs when visual language is executed well or not. 
Design matters, and to that point so does the impact design has on the world around us.
